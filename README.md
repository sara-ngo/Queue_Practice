# Queue_Practice

### LinkedDeque.java
A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced “deck”) is a generalization of a stack
and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data
structure

### ResizingArrayRandomQueue.java
A random queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is
chosen uniformly at random from items in the data structure

### Subset.java
Write a client program Subset.java that takes a command-line integer k , reads in
a sequence of strings from standard input using StdIn.readString() , and prints out exactly k of
them, uniformly at random.
